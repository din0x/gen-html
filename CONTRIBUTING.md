# Contributing

Thanks for being interested in contributing to `gen-html`. Here are some tips to get you started:

- Check existing issues before opening a new one.
- Commits should follow [conventional commits], eg. should be prefixed with `FEAT`, `FIX` or `DOCS`.
- Most commits should include tests and a [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) entry.
